## Preql - Declarative, Concept Oriented, Typed SQL
---
Preql is a higher-level declarative lanuage that can compile to SQL against a variety of database 
backends. It is similar to LookML or other semantic modeling languages, but is focused on defining
all business logic in the semantic layer with only a very loose coupling to any specific
database implementation. 

For context, view the [language overview](https://github.com/preqldata/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md)

This repo contains the syntax and language overview, but no specific implementation of the spec.

To try Preql, use the [experimental python interpreter](https://github.com/preqldata/pypreql).
